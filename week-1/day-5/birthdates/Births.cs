    // Create a function that
    // - takes the name of a CSV file as a parameter,
    //   - every row is in the following format: <person name>;<birthdate in YYYY-MM-DD format>;<city name>
    // - and returns the year when the most births happened.
    //   - if there were multiple years with the same number of births then return any of them

    // You can find such a CSV file in this directory named births.csv
    // If you pass "births.csv" to your function, the result should be either 2006 or 2016.
