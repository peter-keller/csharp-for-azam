# Sharpie Set

- Reuse your `Sharpie` class
- Create `SharpieSet` class
  - it contains a list of Sharpie
  - it has a method that adds a new Sharpie to the set:
    `Add(sharpie)`
  - it has a method that returns the number of usable Sharpies:
    `CountUsable()` -> sharpie is usable if it contains ink
  - it has a method that removes all unusable Sharpies:
    `RemoveTrash()`
