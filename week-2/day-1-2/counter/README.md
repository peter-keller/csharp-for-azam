# Counter

- Create `Counter` class
  - which has a `counter` (integer) field
  - at creation it should have a default value `0` or can be specified
  by a parameter
  - we can add another whole number to this counter: `add(number)`
  - we can just increase the counter's value by one: `add()` (no parameters)
  - we can `get()` the current counter value
  - and we can `reset()` the counter to the initial value
