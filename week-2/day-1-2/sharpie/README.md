# Sharpie

- Create a `Sharpie` class
  - We should know the followings about each sharpie:
    - `color` (which should be a string),
    - `width` (which will be a floating point number) and the
    - `inkAmount` (another floating point number)
  - We need to specify the `color` and the `width` at creation
  - Every sharpie is created with a default `inkAmount` value: `100`
  - We can `Use()` the sharpie objects: using it decreases
    `inkAmount` by `10`
