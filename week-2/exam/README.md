# Project Exercises

Draw fractals with recursive functions.

## Acceptance criteria

- Create and use classes (eg. Triangle, Circle, Line) with methods (eg. draw
  function with coordinates as parameters)

## Experience points

- Each fractal has a certain amount of experience points (XP) that can be earned
  by completing it
- To level up and journey safely to the next week's challenges make sure you
  earn at least 8 XP.
- You need to complete at least 2 tasks that worth `1 XP` and 1 task that's worth `2xp`.
- You also need to earn `Bonus XP` on one of the tasks that you choose.
- The above 2 conditions doesn't apply if you complete a task worth `2 XP` and apply all the `Bonus XP` scenarios on it, adding up to `8 XP`
- *Tip: Copy the corresponding boilerplate from the drawing workshop.*

### Bonus XPs

- make it multi-color for 1 XP
- make the sizes slightly change randomly for 1 XP
- make it animate for 4 XPs

## What is a fractal?

> A fractal is a mathematical set that exhibits a repeating pattern displayed at
> every scale. It is also known as expanding symmetry or evolving symmetry.
