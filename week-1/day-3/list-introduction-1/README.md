# List introduction 1

We are going to play with lists. Feel free to use the built-in methods where
possible.

- Create an empty list which will contain names (strings)
- Print out the number of elements in the list
- Add William to the list
- Print out whether the list is empty or not
- Add John to the list
- Add Amanda to the list
- Print out the number of elements in the list
- Print out the 3rd element
- Iterate through the list and print out each name
  ```text
  William
  John
  Amanda
  ```
- Iterate through the list and print
  ```text
  1. William
  2. John
  3. Amanda
  ```
- Remove the 2nd element
- Iterate through the list in a reversed order and print out each name
  ```text
  Amanda
  William
  ```
- Remove all elements
