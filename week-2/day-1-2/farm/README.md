# Farm

- Reuse your `Animal` class
- Create a `Farm` class
  - it has a list of Animals
  - it has a limit that defines how many animals can be kept in the Farm
  - it has two methods:
    - `breed()` -> creates a new animal if there's place for it
    - `sell()` -> removes the least hungry animal
